My JS/Java Code for LeetCode.

The README is updated weekly. 

Please give this repo a :star: if it inspires you. Thanks. :blush:

ðŸ˜© Hate manually copy & pasting the example testcases when solving LeetCode problems?  
ðŸ‘‰ Try my husband Richard's [LeetCode Testcase Extractor](https://liuzhenglai.com/post/5e6f2551e9a0d01760b274d8)

Now I'm using a Chrome Extension Richard developed -- [LeetCoder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gkmoalkjclphfhgnhdlilebaolpdkgpf) -- to facilitate my having fun on LeetCode. Features including but not limited to:
* showing stats
* copying problem, answer and **testcases**
* randomly picking a problem.
